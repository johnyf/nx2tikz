About
=====

`nx2tikz` is a package for exporting [`networkx`](https://networkx.org)
graphs directly to [`TikZ`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ), letting
[`TikZ` itself layout the graph](https://doi.org/10.7155/jgaa.00301).
The generated TikZ code can be typeset using [LuaTeX](
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuaTeX).
The package can be used to convert a `networkx` graph to:
- a PDF depicting the graph
- LaTeX code for a `tikzpicture`, containing TikZ code describing the graph
  (to be included in a LaTeX document)
- LaTeX code for a complete LaTeX document,
  containing TikZ code describing the graph

These are possible via two interfaces:
- from Python by calling functions from `nx2tikz`, with a `networkx` graph
  as argument
- from the command line, by passing the name of a Python script that contains
  a function that returns a `networkx` graph

The purpose of package `nx2tikz` is to avoid the
[`pydot`](https://pypi.org/project/pydot/) ->
[`GraphViz`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) ->
[`dot2tex`](https://github.com/kjellmf/dot2tex) ->
[`dot2texi`](https://github.com/kjellmf/dot2texisty) toolchain,
because it is very fragile and inflexible.


Usage
=====

The package can be:
- imported in Python, or
- invoked from the command line.


## using `nx2tikz` from Python

The Python package can be imported with

```python
import nx2tikz
```

Assuming that `g` is an instance of a `networkx` graph, the following are
available:
- `nx2tikz.dumps_tikz(g)` returns as string the code of a `tikzpicture`
  environment that contains TikZ code describing the graph
- `nx2tikz.dump_tikz(g, filename)` creates a file named `filename` that
  contains the code of a `tikzpicture` environment that describes the graph
- `nx2tikz.dump_pdf(g, filename)` creates a PDF file named `filename` that
  contains a diagram of the graph. It calls `lualatex` to typeset the PDF file.

Read also the docstrings of these functions for more information.

Another useful function is `nx2tikz.nx2tikz.dump_tex`, which creates a LaTeX
file for a document to typeset a diagram of the graph (includes preamble).


## using `nx2tikz` from the command line

The input on the command line is a Python module that contains a function
named `graph`. The function `graph` should return a `networkx` graph.

To write a `tikzpicture` as a file:

```shell
nx2tikz --input example.py --output out.tex --format tikz
```

When you include such pictures in your main document, remember to import the
necessary TikZ packages in the preamble, for example:

```latex
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{graphs,graphs.standard,graphdrawing,quotes,shapes}
\usegdlibrary{force}
```

and compile with `lualatex`.

To directly compile with `lualatex` an image as a PDF file:

```shell
nx2tikz --input example.py --output out --format pdf
```

To dump an entire LaTeX document, complete with preamble:

```shell
nx2tikz --input example.py --output out --format tex
```

An example for using `nx2tikz` is the Python script `examples/example.py`.


Installation
============

Using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io):

```shell
pip install .
```

The package also installs in Python's `bin/` directory a script named `nx2tikz`
as [entry point](
    https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html).
This script can be invoked from the command line, for example:

```shell
nx2tikz -h
```
